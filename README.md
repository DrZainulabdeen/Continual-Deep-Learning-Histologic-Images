# Continual Deep Learning For Histologic Images

There is a lot of data currently available on so many different topic, and to train the Network its not sufficient that we use all this data. Active Learning  framework helps overcome this problem so we can only feed the data to our model iteratively. In this project I will explore different strategies that can be used to select the data which is actullly beneficial to our model rather than feeding everything. We will start with strategies to select which data is more useful by using Uncertainty Sampling techniques that are:

1) Entropy
2)Least Confidence
3)Margin Sampling
